						The shining diamonds gather for their first mission.
						After sitting in to the war preparation meeting, they
						receive their orders and their first mission is to take
						place in the Doku no numachi region : the poisonous
						swamps of the north.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						They get aquainted with the different steps of going on
						an official mission, meet the Diviner, the Alchemist and
						the general store owner.
					</p>
					<p>
						The diviner gave them their first prophecy : The essence
						of the unnamed beast can be felt more strongly in the
						nort-eastern section of the region. Beware the vines of
						the earth mover. Poisonous are his tendrils and deadly
						are his trails. Deep lays your destinies and deaths. The
						smoking traitor will guide you if you don't follow it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The alchemist gave them a few concoctions and in return,
						asked them to get her a special root found only in the
						rivers of the Doku no numachi region. Recognized by it's
						pinkish redish hue and it's flower ressembling a baby's
						head.
					</p>
					<p>
						The general store owner gave them the basics and how to
						use it. We're talking transporters, bag of equipments,
						rations, traps, tranquilizers, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						They spent their last night in Monsutāhantā and then
						went on their first expedition as the shining diamonds.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first 3 days went without a hitch, they kept a fast
						pace and made a lot of headway towards their
						destination. On the fourth day however, in spite of
						kadesh's warning, they attracted the attention of 2
						water weirds. It's time to prove their worth in combat.

						<h5>Year 180am, 16-06 to 18-06</h5>
						<p>2024-10-30</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						The shining diamonds dispatched the water weirds quickly
						and efficiently, as expected of them.
					</p>
					<p>
						After one last day of rest in their home region of Heiwa
						no mori, they entered the Doku no numachi region to the
						North. Surrounded by mud, water and insects, they
						started the hard journey toward the north-western part
						of the region.
					</p>
					<p>
						Keeping their eyes peeled for traces of their quarry or
						the flowers the alchemist requested, they trekked all
						day until time to make camp. They found neither.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the night, a strange form haunted all of them one
						by one during their hours of guard duty. A massive 15ft
						high "mound" moving silently and quickly through the
						vegetations. Not willing to explore alone during the
						night, they opted to wait until morning to see what it
						was.
					</p>
					<p>
						The morning after, they gathered themselves and made
						their way to the spot where the misterious form had been
						seen. They found no trace of a massive creature on the
						ground, nor in the fauna surrounding the space. All they
						found were small holes on an elevated circle of dirt in
						the ground. A quick examination by Chakrum and Aku (or
						the Nature brothers) revealed the holes to not be a
						natural occurences. Someone or something had placed them
						there.
					</p>
					<p>
						After a little more investigation involving water and a
						lot of force by Amara, they discovered the cause : a big
						fat mass of purple flesh lingered underneath. Inside the
						mass of flesh was nothing of note. Their education in
						monster anatomy revealed the mass to be an egg sac or
						placenta of some kind. Unclear. No trace of the creature
						or what the thing contained however.
					</p>
					<p>
						Carrying on for the day, they followed the trails as
						best they could in the hostile territory until they
						found massive trenches going up and down hills and
						through rivers and vegetation, indicating it's
						non-natural origins.
					</p>
					<p>
						In one of the trenches, they found what seemed to be
						struggling vines detached from the earth. After a closer
						inspection, they realised the vines were still alive,
						prickly and really poisonous. With the prophecy they
						received, they assumed the vines to be related to the
						monster and decided to make camp for they day and use
						the poison from them to make potions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Chakrum and Amara tried to gather the vines and make
						potions with moderate success
					</p>
					<p>
						Aku and Kadesh tried to hunt and gather for food but
						unfortunatly, only found food good enough for Hoozbert.
						(At least one of them was happy)
					</p>
					<p>
						Having spent their day, they decide to camp and continue
						their search in the morning
					</p>

						<h5>Year 180am, 18-06 to 20-06</h5>
						<p>2024-11-06</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						The shining diamonds continued their search. With
						observation and deduction, they found out that somehow,
						the hulking mass they saw in the swamp for a few days
						now was only a smoke illusion comming from the earth.
						They decided to avoid it and keep following the trails
						for of vines.
					</p>
					<p>
						One night, during camp, they got attacked by giant frogs
						who didn't like their fires but dispatched them quickly,
						gaining a lot of food in the process with Chakrum
						cheffing it up during his guard duty.
					</p>
					<p>
						They continued to follow the trail and found a river
						with petals flowing down the opposite direction. It
						ended up being the flowers looked for by the alchemist.
						After some good nature and perception checks, they
						grabbed the flowers without problems and continued on
						their way.
					</p>
					<p>
						On the fifth day of their adventure in the swamps, they
						finally found what they were looking for. The end of the
						trail, a tunnel carved in a spire forming the mountain
						line separating the Doku no numachi region and the Yōgan
						Hara region. The tunnel seemed to go deep underground. A
						choice now stands before them. Enter the tunnel to face
						the creature, fighting in it's own turf but having a
						chance to take it by surprise or wait for it outside,
						trying to lay a trap but making sure it would be awake
						and ready for a fight.

						<h5>Year 180am, 20-06 to 20-06</h5>
						<p>2024-11-20</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						The shining diamonds found the lair of the beast. They
						tried luring it out but unfortunatly, they also lured
						out protectors of the lair. They had to fight them
						before the creature they came here for showed up.
						Spending few ressources doing so, they sent running the
						protectors, giant ants with human sized claws and
						protective carapaces before the final showdown. The
						beast emerged from underground, a millipede/beatle
						hybrid with giant arms and poisonous tendrils on it's
						back. The fight went well for the team although some of
						their companion ended up downed (or crushed. Looking at
						you hoozbert), they came out on top and even managed to
						capture the giant beasts on their first try with nobody
						dying.
					</p>
					<p>
						Aku kept everyone alive, Chakrum occupied the beast most
						of the fight while Kadesh and Amara tried to bring it
						down as fast as possible. A well oiled machine.

						<h5>Year 180am, 20-06 to 1-07</h5>

					</div>
					<p>
						The shining diamonds embarked on the way home, beast in
						tow, with the joy of knowing they accomplished
						everything they set out to do. The way home went
						smoothly although, some of them saw some weird
						phenomenons on their way to the village. Not much to be
						done about it but still they kept it in mind to ask back
						at the village.
					</p>
					<p>
						When they arrived, a big feast was organised for them.
						They were the first team back from their mission. Fun
						and alcool was had by all that day. Weapons, armors and
						companions got upgraded. The other teams arrived later
						that week. They asked about the weird phenomeons they
						saw during their way back, stars glitching out, the sky
						turning day during the night but got no answers from the
						rest of the village. In fact, they seemed to avoid the
						subjet. With some good insight from members of the team
						and a dodgy conversation between the council president
						and the general store manager spied on by Kadesh, they
						gathered that something wasn't right. They were being
						lied to. About what? Who knows. At the end of the week,
						only one team did not come back : the flower eaters.
					</p>
					<p>
						After a week of rest, it is now time for the shining
						diamonds to go back out there but this time, on a rescue
						mission. Saving the flower eaters.

						<h5>Year 180am, 1-07 to 11-07</h5>
						<p>2024-12-04</p>
					</div>
					<p>
						The shining diamonds get ready to rescue the flowers
						eaters. The team they are going to save is composed of :
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Lucia, the healing archer with her bow, Leaf</li>
						<li>
							Borgor, the thundering hammer with his hammer, Storm
						</li>
						<li>
							Valak, the lancer and his lance and shield combo,
							Home and Security
						</li>
						<li>Karia, the javelineer and her javelin, Valiero</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The beast is located in the Nadarakana heigen region.
						The council have given them the prophecy that was given
						to the first team : The essence of the unnamed beast can
						be felt more strongly in the north-eastern part of the
						region. The silken waves of destiny float high when the
						sky burns in the mountain. The song of death falls upon
						you so shield your hearts, brave beings, as the heat of
						passion will consume you otherwise.
					</p>
					<p>
						The alchemist provides them with potions to help them
						climb as this mission seems to bring them in the
						mountains. She also gives them potions to speed up their
						travel, thanks to the plants they brought back on their
						last mission. With the poisonous tendrils of the last
						beast they slayed, she made poisons that they can also
						use.
					</p>
					<p>
						The general store owner gives them rations enough for 31
						days of travel. It should cover for their companions if
						they find them alive.
					</p>
					<p>
						Before leaving, Aku has a weird dream where he feels
						acid poured down his veins and his arms melt away. Has
						he wakes up, he sees the door to his chambers close and
						hears footsteps in the hallway. When he goes to look, he
						can see no one. Spooked, he goes back to sleep but as he
						does, he notices blood on his hand and a tingle in his
						neck. He touches it to feel a small incision on his
						neck, as if a small puncture wound had been done to him.
						In the morning, he notices that the same little wound
						can be found on all his team mates.
					</p>
					<p>
						They try to go talk to Shirak Vahir, the council elder
						but has they arrive at his home, he cannot be found.
						They then leave for the mountains.
					</p>
					<p>
						The travel is uneventfull, they use the potions given to
						them by the alchemist to speed up during the first 2
						days and then follow to path to Nadarakana heigen. After
						a week of walking, they end up finding tracks of their
						quarry, as well as camps left behind. They follow as
						best they can on a path that goes up a mountain.
					</p>
					<p>
						As they go up the mountain, they have an encounter with
						Cyclops trying to stop them from advancing, they have a
						small curfufle but end up beating them quite easily.
						After the fight, the eyes of Kadesh and his trusty
						companion Spotter notice an unusual shine at the feet of
						the mountain. They find the hammer of Borgor, encrusted
						into the earth, as if it fell a great distance. On it,
						they find a semi-transparent web-like substance with a
						strange smell. They decided to camp there for the night
						before starting to climb up the perrilous wall of the
						mountain.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the night, while they were on guard duty, every
						one of them heard a deep, sad and melodius song. The
						song captured their attention to the point that nothing
						else could be heard. No wind, no insect, not even their
						own breath. It lasted all night. It seemed to come from
						up the mountain. Didn't seem to have any ill effects.
						For now.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the morning, the shining diamonds started the process
						of going up. With care for some, and ease for others,
						they got to a small ledge where they could discuss
						strategy. All of them except one opted to put their
						earwax in, given to them by the general store owner. To
						protect them from the song.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the ledge, the side of the mountain seemed covered
						in the translucent web-like substrance discovered on the
						hammer. They were getting close. They let Hoozbert go
						ahead first to clear it with his acidic trail, trying to
						not let the creature know of their approach.
