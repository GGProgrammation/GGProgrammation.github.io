						The shining diamonds gather for their first mission.
						After sitting in to the war preparation meeting, they
						receive their orders and their first mission is to take
						place in the Doku no numachi region : the poisonous
						swamps of the north.{" "}
					</p>
					<p>
						They get aquainted with the different steps of going on
						an official mission, meet the Diviner, the Alchemist and
						the general store owner.
					</p>
					<p>
						The diviner gave them their first prophecy : The essence
						of the unnamed beast can be felt more strongly in the
						nort-eastern section of the region. Beware the vines of
						the earth mover. Poisonous are his tendrils and deadly
						are his trails. Deep lays your destinies and deaths. The
						smoking traitor will guide you if you don't follow it.
					</p>
					<p>
						The alchemist gave them a few concoctions and in return,
						asked them to get her a special root found only in the
						rivers of the Doku no numachi region. Recognized by it's
						pinkish redish hue and it's flower ressembling a baby's
						head.
					</p>
					<p>
						The general store owner gave them the basics and how to
						use it. We're talking transporters, bag of equipments,
						rations, traps, tranquilizers, etc.
					</p>
					<p>
						They spent their last night in Monsutāhantā and then
						went on their first expedition as the shining diamonds.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first 3 days went without a hitch, they kept a fast
						pace and made a lot of headway towards their
						destination. On the fourth day however, in spite of
						kadesh's warning, they attracted the attention of 2
						water weirds. It's time to prove their worth in combat.
