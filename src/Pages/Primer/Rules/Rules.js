						NB : This is just to inform me of what we will work
						towards in the campain. If you are a healer, it doesn't
						mean you will not be able to do damage. The same goes
						for damage dealers, it doesn't mean you can't tank or
						heal on the side if that's what you want. It will
						however help me to craft upgrades/spells/actions that
						will be aligned with what you want for your character.
					</dd>
					<dd>
						NB2: I have put 0 summoning archetypes. This was
						intentionnal. There will be no summoning of other
						creatures as to try and keep this simple. To compensate,

					but also the monsters you fight, their strategy and the
					traps you will face as you will most likely end up in their
					lair. I will try my best to make things fair but this will
